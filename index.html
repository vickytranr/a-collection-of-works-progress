                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I inspiration from various sources such as games, illustrators and other websites. One website, Falling Falling, was interesting in the way it used colour and big shapes; from this piece, I wanted a set colour palette. The style of my site was reminiscent of an illustrator that I follow, Liliuhms, who has an almost childish style similar to doodles and bright colours. Some games such as Chicory: A Colorful Tale and Before Your Eyes inspired the childlike aesthetic I was going for, especially in the case of Chicory which makes use of a paintbrush as a game mechanic. This inspired the itneraction I wanted to implement.

                <p>I created the basis of the content I was going to style and created individual pages for each reading and exercise, which in turn I could style with one stylesheet.</p>

                <p>I settled on the final colour palette and narrowed down the way my page would look, and focused on including my interaction, which was a drawing pen with colours, inspired by Chicory.</p>

                  <p>I extensively researched resources that could help form the basis of my interaction, which helped with developing it, and refined it to suit my index more, by editing what colours could be used, where elements were located, and brush size.</p>

                <p>I had also added animations and refined the placement of each element.</p>
                <h2>Final Index</h2>
                <p>In the end, I wanted to include my interest in illustration and included them as visual interest that would add texture and help my website fit the aesthetic I envisioned. Visitors are encouraged to draw on the page, and be contribute to the look of it in their interactions with the index. Subsequent reading and exercise pages were also styled so that they reflect the style of the original index.</p>
